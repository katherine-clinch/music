    <p>I really like a game called <em>Dutch Blitz.</em> I played it with my family growing up. We'd usually play it around holidays. Sometimes, we'd have family friends over to play it with us, and had tournaments. It's an exciting game. I want to start a <strong>Dutch Blitz League</strong> here in <strong>Austin</strong>. My best friend, <strong>Sofia</strong> and I were planning on hosting a tournament this November. I don't think it's going to work out, though, because we are having some crazy issues with the apartment we were supposed to move into 2 weeks ago. Sometime in the future.</p>
