    <p>I am obsessed with <em>Dutch Blitz</em> - a game my friends and I enjoy together. I have fond memories of playing the game with my family and our neighbors around Christmas time growing up. I still make my family play it with me every year, but they don't have as much fun with it as I do anymore. I have dreams of starting a <strong>Dutch Blitz League</strong> here in <strong>Austin</strong>. My best friend, <strong>Sofia</strong>, and I were planning on hosting a tournament this November, but I don't think it's going to work out due to issues with the apartment we were supposed to move into 2 weeks ago. Sometime in the future.</p>
